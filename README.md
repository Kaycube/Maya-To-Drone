# Maya-To-Drone Connnection Script

This is a project that is targeted at solving camera flyovers from the previsualization stage to production on a live set. The Goal is to previsualize a UAV camera movement inside Maya, export the animations of the movement and port it directly to a drone and execute the previsualized motion. This project is till in the development phase and has a few bugs.

# TODO:
- Build an app for a UAV (Ideally DJI Inspire 2) that can read the exported animation data out of Maya

# Wish List:
-Connect to Maya in realtime
